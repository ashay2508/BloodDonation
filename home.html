				<h5 >WHY SHOULD YOU DONATE BLOOD?<br>
Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:<br>

<ol type="1"><li>women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;</li>
<li>children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;</li>
<li>people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; and</li>
<li>many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.</li></ol><br>
It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.
<br>
There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.
<br>
Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</h5>
